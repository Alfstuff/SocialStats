# SocialStats
A tool to help with social network statistic tracking!

This program can be used to grab social media statistics from many networks such as:

* Instagram
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Youtube

Since SocialStats is written in Python, it's cross-platform.

Currently, we're working on publicly available stats with an option to sign in in the roadmap. Feel free to add suggestions!
Also, a GUI is in the works, hopefully written in Qt.
